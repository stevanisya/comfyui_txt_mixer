# ComfyUI Text Mixer Node

Concatenate multiple text inputs into a single output.

- Auto-expanding inputs: a spare slot is always available. Connect to it and a new one appears, disconnect and it gets removed
- Separator option to choose how inputs are joined (newline, paragraph, none, space, or comma)
